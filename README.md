# FinalCodingProjectTDA

authors: Abby Headstrom & Abby Irish
Our project explores the method of persistent homology used in topological data analysis (TDA), which characterizes the shape of data using holes. Holes are a significant topological feature in many data sets and tend to be robust to noise. This can be represented by persistence diagrams, which are collection of pointsâ€“each corresponds to feature that appears at scale x and disappears at scale y. Persistence diagrams can then be used to create persistence images which are a type vector representation needed in order to perform ML techniques such as SVM.
